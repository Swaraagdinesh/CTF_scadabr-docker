<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  <b>Users</b> represent individuals who use the system. Various privileges can be assigned to users to grant them the 
  ability to read and alter data and system behaviour.
</p>

<p>
  There are two basic user levels: administrators (<img src="images/user_suit.png"/>), and other users 
  (<img src="images/user_green.png"/>). Administrators have access to all system functionality. Other users have 
  various privileges based upon configuration.
</p>

<h1>Editing users</h1>
<p>
  To add a new user, click the <img src="images/user_add.png"/> icon. The user will not actually be added until it is 
  successfully saved. To edit an existing user, click the user's name in the "Users" list.
</p>
<p>
  Passwords are not retrievable once they have been saved; they can only be reset by specifying a new password.
</p>
<p>
  A disabled user is not allowed to log in. To delete a user, click the <img src="images/delete.png"/> icon.
</p>
<p>
  To test a user's email address, click the <img src="images/email_go.png"/> icon. This will cause an email to be sent 
  to the specified email address.
</p>
<p>
  Users may have alarm notification emails sent to their email addresses without explicitly being specified on an email 
  event handler. Selecting a <b>Send alarm emails</b> alarm level above "none" will cause these notifications to be 
  sent when the event's alarm level is greater than or equal to the user's minimum alarm level, but only when the event 
  is raised (i.e. no escalation or inactive notifications). Note also that if the user is already specified on an email 
  event handler, they will not be sent multiple emails.
</p>

<h1>User privileges</h1>
<p>The <b>Administrator</b> checkbox determines if this user is an administrator.</p>
<p>
  If the user is not an administrator, all data sources for the customer will be listed. Checking the box next to the 
  data source name indicates that the user can alter the data source settings, as well as access all data produced by 
  that data source.
</p>
<p>
  If the data source is not checked, a list of all points within the data source will be displayed. Each point can be 
  individually set for no access, read access, or&mdash;if the point is settable&mdash;write access. (Having write 
  access implies have read access.)
</p>

  Alternativamente, desde o ScadaBR 1.1 voc&ecirc; pode definir um conjunto de permiss&otilde;es para um grupo de usu&aacute;rios atrav&eacute;s dos "Perfis de Usu&aacute;rios".
  Neste caso, as permiss&otilde;es individuais para cada "data source" ser&atilde;o ocultadas. Al&eacute;m dos "data sources", os Perfis de Usu&aacute;rio tamb&eacute;m permitem
  alterar as permiss&otilde;es para "watch lists" e representa&ccedil;&otilde;es gr&aacute;ficas. Perfis de Usu&aacute;rios s&oacute; podem ser definidos para usu&aacute;rios que
  n&atilde;o s&atilde;o administradores.
</p-->
<p>
  Alternatively, since ScadaBR 1.1 you can define a set of permissions for a group of users through the "User Profiles".
  In this case, individual permissions for each data source will be hidden. In addition to data sources, User
  Profiles also allow changing permissions for watch lists and graphical views. User Profiles can only be
  associated to users who are not administrators.
