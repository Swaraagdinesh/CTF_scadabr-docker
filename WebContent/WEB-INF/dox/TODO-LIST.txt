Hello ScadaBR community!

These are the documentation pages that need to be written:

dnp3IpDS.htm
dnp3SerialDS.htm
maintenanceEvents.htm (there is a sketch in Portuguese)
persistentDP.htm
persistentDS.htm
persistentPublishing.htm
viconicsDS.htm
viconicsPP.htm

Several other pages still need to be translated.
Please, if you are a multilingual speaker,
help with the translation of these files.
